<hr />
Here            is          some             text. 
Type       it            like                this. 
Notice how the browser blithely ignores my white space.
<br />You need a break tag to move to the next line.
<p>A paragraph tag creates a blank line, white space, above itself.</p>
<br/>Notice how the tags are lower case.
<p>For XHTML lower case tags are required. All XHTML elements must be closed. That also means tags like break, paragraph, and image must be "self-closing." Your code must also be "well-formed" (Tags must be properly nested. Ask me about it in class.) bold italic and bold-italic</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Here's a small table</td>
 <td>row 1, cell 2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
<td>row 2, cell 1</td>
 <td>row 2, cell 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can specify all sorts of things in a table, but we're staying simple.</p>
